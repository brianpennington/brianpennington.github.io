            <p>It is often said that Dallas is where the east ends and Fort Worth is where the west begins. Certainly, 
                it is true that when you think of Fort Worth, 
                you think of pickup trucks and cowboy boots and Billy Bob's at the Fort Worth Stockyards and when you think of Dallas, 
                you think of BMW's and banking and Highland Park. The question for someone considering moving to the DFW area, 
                though, is: is there a difference in the neighborhoods in Fort Worth and Dallas?
                <br><br>
                <b>This project will investigate whether there are any systematic differences in Dallas vs. Fort Worth nighborhoods.</b></p>

            <p> 
                The geodata used for this project is from the Zillow US Neighborhoods dataset.
                The dataset has over 17,300 neighboorhood boundaries in the largest cities in the U.S.  
                The Zillow data team used various tactics to collect the data, including calling individual chambers of commerce, tourism and convention boards, speaking with real estate agents and community members in these areas, as well as using available online local sources.
                <br><br>
                The Zillow dataset contains full geoshape data for each neighborhood
                as well as properties sections that contain the neighborhood name, regionid, a two-dimensional geopoint, city, county and state.
                <br><br>
                Zillow makes this data available for free under a Creative Commons licence. All that is required to use the files is to attribute Zillow as the source
                of the data and make any updates or change you make to the files available to everyone else via the same or similar license.
                The data can be downloaded at the <a href="https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/zillow-neighborhoods%40public/export/" 
                target="_blank">opendatasoft website <i class="fa fa-download"></i></a>.
                <br><br>
                The data is available in a variety of formats including csv (comma-separated values), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), Excel,
                 GeoJSON, Shapefile and KML (Keyhole Markup Language).  We used GeoJSON files.   
                GeoJSON is an open standard format based on the JSON that was designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. 
                <br><br></p>

            <h4><i class="fa fa-foursquare"></i> <b>Place Data</b> by <b>Foursquare:</b>  </h3>
            <p>Information about the neighborhoods was collected using the Foursquare Places database.  
                The Places database has an extensive amount of venue data and user content that can be accessed using geolocation data. 
                The database contains "firmographic" data and "rich community-sourced content" for more than 60 million commercial places around the world.
                For each venue, there are over 90 attributes that can be accessed, including the venue name, address, gelocation, category as well as ratings, tips and photos. 
                <br><br>
                We focused on the information about the types of venues that are located in the neighborhoods to determine whether neighborhoods are similar or not.

            <ol>
                <li>GeoJSON files containing the neighborhood data for Dallas and Fort Worth were downloaded from the opensoftdata web site.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The files were read using the geojson library and the neighborhood properties and boundary coordinates were appended to a dataframe.</li>
                        <li>The geo_point_2d column was split into Latitude and Longitude columns and that column as well as the regionid were dropped.</li>
                        <li>There are 425 neighborhoods, 225 in Fort Worth with the remainder in Dallas--
                            and it's suburbs of Carollton, Desoto, Garland, Irving, Mesquite, Plano and Richardson.</li>

                <li>Venue Categories as the target item</li>
                    <p>When we initially ran a cluster analysis on the venue categories (map below), the residential neighborhoods
                        were readily identifiable.  There were a handful of neighborhoods that had golf courses, 
                        a few that only had parks,
                        and some that only had convenience or discount stores.  
                        But almost two-thirds of the neighborhoods were grouped into a large cluster 
                        that could best be characterized as have "a little bit of everything".  Trying to spot a common theme for this large cluster
                        drew our attention to the "granularity" of the venue categories.  Do we really want to split out Mexican Cuisine into 
                        Mexican Restaurant, Tex-Mex Restaurant, Burrito Place and Taco Place?  Aren't bars, beer bars, cocktail bars, dive bars, gay bars,
                        hotel bars, wine bars, lounges, and pubs all "drinking establishments"?  Is anything gained by distinguishing between Gyms,
                        Boxing Gyms, Gymnastics Gyms and Gym/Fitness Centers?
